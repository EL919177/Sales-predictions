# Sales-predictions
This repository functions to predict food sales
Author: Edwin Ramirez

The goal is to determine what factors we can determine from the data have greater impact on food sales.

Data:
In our observation, the feature with the greater level of impacat is the Item MRP, in which the decreased visibilty, the greater the Item sales 
happens to be.

The methods used to explain this phenomenon, we compared this with the other features through the Outlet Establishment Years and noted the 
stark contrast in sales performacne when Item MRP was at it's highest. This is even factoring even the imputed missing data.

Now, we have previously mentioned, the data had a varied set of missing data in which was imputed via different means. 
Even still, we would recommend, as to ascertain a better predictive model to encourage limitations on data entry so as to accurately reflect the 
features that would determine better sales performance.
